    for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
    configuration items are configured in the generic
    "<code class="literal">[Unit]</code>" and "<code class="literal">[Install]</code>"
    sections. The service specific configuration options are
    configured in the "<code class="literal">[Service]</code>" section.</p><p>Additional options are listed in
    <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.exec</span>(5)</span></a>,

    which configure resource control settings for the processes of the
    service.</p><p>If a service is requested under a certain name but no unit
    configuration file is found, systemd looks for a SysV init script
    by the same name (with the <code class="filename">.service</code> suffix
    removed) and dynamically creates a service unit from that script.
    This is useful for compatibility with SysV. Note that this
    compatibility is quite comprehensive but not 100%. For details
    about the incompatibilities, see the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Incompatibilities" target="_top">Incompatibilities

    their activated <code class="filename">.socket</code> units via an
    automatic <code class="varname">After=</code> dependency.</p><p>Unless <code class="varname">DefaultDependencies=</code> in the "<code class="literal">[Unit]</code>" is set to
    <code class="option">false</code>, service units will implicitly have dependencies of type <code class="varname">Requires=</code> and
    <code class="varname">After=</code> on <code class="filename">sysinit.target</code>, a dependency of type <code class="varname">After=</code> on
    <code class="filename">basic.target</code> as well as dependencies of type <code class="varname">Conflicts=</code> and
    <code class="varname">Before=</code> on <code class="filename">shutdown.target</code>. These ensure that normal service units pull in
    basic system initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to system shutdown. Only services involved with early
    boot or late system shutdown should disable this option.</p><p>Instanced service units (i.e. service units with an "<code class="literal">@</code>" in their name) are assigned by
    default a per-template slice unit (see
    <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.slice</span>(5)</span></a>), named after the
    template unit, containing all instances of the specific template. This slice is normally stopped at shutdown,
    together with all template instances. If that is not desired, set <code class="varname">DefaultDependencies=no</code> in the
    template unit, and either define your own per-template slice unit file that also sets
    <code class="varname">DefaultDependencies=no</code>, or set <code class="varname">Slice=system.slice</code> (or another suitable slice)
    in the template unit. Also see

    of service units are the following:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="Type="><span class="term"><code class="varname">Type=</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#Type=">¶</a></dt><dd><p>Configures the process start-up type for this
        service unit. One of
        <code class="option">simple</code>,
        <code class="option">forking</code>,
        <code class="option">oneshot</code>,
        <code class="option">dbus</code>,
        <code class="option">notify</code> or
        <code class="option">idle</code>.</p><p>If set to <code class="option">simple</code> (the default if
        neither <code class="varname">Type=</code> nor
        <code class="varname">BusName=</code>, but <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code>
        are specified), it is expected that the process configured
        with <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code> is the main process of the
        service. In this mode, if the process offers functionality to
        other processes on the system, its communication channels
        should be installed before the daemon is started up (e.g.
        sockets set up by systemd, via socket activation), as systemd
        will immediately proceed starting follow-up units.</p><p>If set to <code class="option">forking</code>, it is expected that
        the process configured with <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code> will
        call <code class="function">fork()</code> as part of its start-up. The
        parent process is expected to exit when start-up is complete
        and all communication channels are set up. The child continues
        to run as the main daemon process. This is the behavior of
        traditional UNIX daemons. If this setting is used, it is
        recommended to also use the <code class="varname">PIDFile=</code>
        option, so that systemd can identify the main process of the
        daemon. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units as
        soon as the parent process exits.</p><p>Behavior of <code class="option">oneshot</code> is similar to
        <code class="option">simple</code>; however, it is expected that the
        process has to exit before systemd starts follow-up units.
        <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code> is particularly useful for
        this type of service. This is the implied default if neither
        <code class="varname">Type=</code> or <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code> are
        specified.</p><p>Behavior of <code class="option">dbus</code> is similar to
        <code class="option">simple</code>; however, it is expected that the
        daemon acquires a name on the D-Bus bus, as configured by
        <code class="varname">BusName=</code>. systemd will proceed with
        starting follow-up units after the D-Bus bus name has been
        acquired. Service units with this option configured implicitly
        gain dependencies on the <code class="filename">dbus.socket</code>
        unit. This type is the default if <code class="varname">BusName=</code>
        is specified.</p><p>Behavior of <code class="option">notify</code> is similar to
        <code class="option">simple</code>; however, it is expected that the
        daemon sends a notification message via
        <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sd_notify</span>(3)</span></a>
        or an equivalent call when it has finished starting up.
        systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after this
        notification message has been sent. If this option is used,
        <code class="varname">NotifyAccess=</code> (see below) should be set to
        open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If
        <code class="varname">NotifyAccess=</code> is not set, it will be
        implicitly set to <code class="option">main</code>. Note that currently
        <code class="varname">Type=</code><code class="option">notify</code> will not work
        if used in combination with
        <code class="varname">PrivateNetwork=</code><code class="option">yes</code>.</p><p>Behavior of <code class="option">idle</code> is very similar to
        <code class="option">simple</code>; however, actual execution of the
        service binary is delayed until all jobs are dispatched. This
        may be used to avoid interleaving of output of shell services
        with the status output on the console.</p></dd><dt id="RemainAfterExit="><span class="term"><code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#RemainAfterExit=">¶</a></dt><dd><p>Takes a boolean value that specifies whether

        <code class="option">PIDFile=</code> is unset because for the other types

    variable and specifier substitutions for
    <code class="varname">ExecStart=</code>,
    <code class="varname">ExecStartPre=</code>,
    <code class="varname">ExecStartPost=</code>,
    <code class="varname">ExecReload=</code>,
    <code class="varname">ExecStop=</code>, and
    <code class="varname">ExecStopPost=</code> options.</p><p>Multiple command lines may be concatenated in a single
    directive by separating them with semicolons (these semicolons
    must be passed as separate words). Lone semicolons may be escaped
    as "<code class="literal">\;</code>".</p><p>Each command line is split on whitespace, with the first
    item being the command to execute, and the subsequent items being
    the arguments. Double quotes ("...") and single quotes ('...') may
    be used, in which case everything until the next matching quote
    becomes part of the same argument. C-style escapes are also
    supported. The table below contains the list of allowed escape
    patterns. Only patterns which match the syntax in the table are
    allowed; others will result in an error, and must be escaped by
    doubling the backslash. Quotes themselves are removed after
    parsing and escape sequences substituted. In addition, a trailing
    backslash ("<code class="literal">\</code>") may be used to merge lines.
    </p><p>This syntax is intended to be very similar to shell syntax,
    but only the meta-characters and expansions described in the
    following paragraphs are understood. Specifically, redirection
    using
    "<code class="literal">&lt;</code>",
    "<code class="literal">&lt;&lt;</code>",
    "<code class="literal">&gt;</code>", and
    "<code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code>", pipes using
    "<code class="literal">|</code>", running programs in the background using
    "<code class="literal">&amp;</code>", and <span class="emphasis"><em>other elements of shell
    syntax are not supported</em></span>.</p><p>The command to execute must be an absolute path name. It may
    contain spaces, but control characters are not allowed.</p><p>The command line accepts "<code class="literal">%</code>" specifiers as
    described in
    <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.unit</span>(5)</span></a>.
    Note that the first argument of the command line (i.e. the program
    to execute) may not include specifiers.</p><p>Basic environment variable substitution is supported. Use
    "<code class="literal">${FOO}</code>" as part of a word, or as a word of its
    own, on the command line, in which case it will be replaced by the
    value of the environment variable including all whitespace it
    contains, resulting in a single argument. Use
    "<code class="literal">$FOO</code>" as a separate word on the command line, in
    which case it will be replaced by the value of the environment
    variable split at whitespace, resulting in zero or more arguments.
    For this type of expansion, quotes are respected when splitting
    into words, and afterwards removed.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Environment="ONE=one" 'TWO=two two'
ExecStart=/bin/echo $ONE $TWO ${TWO}</pre><p>This will execute <span class="command"><strong>/bin/echo</strong></span> with four
    arguments: "<code class="literal">one</code>", "<code class="literal">two</code>",
    "<code class="literal">two</code>", and "<code class="literal">two two</code>".</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Environment=ONE='one' "TWO='two&nbsp;two'&nbsp;too" THREE=
ExecStart=/bin/echo ${ONE} ${TWO} ${THREE}
ExecStart=/bin/echo $ONE $TWO $THREE</pre><p>This results in <code class="filename">echo</code> being
    called twice, the first time with arguments
    "<code class="literal">'one'</code>",
    "<code class="literal">'two&nbsp;two'&nbsp;too</code>", "<code class="literal"></code>",
    and the second time with arguments
    "<code class="literal">one</code>", "<code class="literal">two&nbsp;two</code>",
    "<code class="literal">too</code>".
    </p><p>To pass a literal dollar sign, use "<code class="literal">$$</code>".
    Variables whose value is not known at expansion time are treated
    as empty strings. Note that the first argument (i.e. the program
    to execute) may not be a variable.</p><p>Variables to be used in this fashion may be defined through
    <code class="varname">Environment=</code> and
    <code class="varname">EnvironmentFile=</code>. In addition, variables listed
    in the section "Environment variables in spawned processes" in
    <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.exec</span>(5)</span></a>,
    which are considered "static configuration", may be used (this
    includes e.g. <code class="varname">$USER</code>, but not
    <code class="varname">$TERM</code>).</p><p>Note that shell command lines are not directly supported. If
    shell command lines are to be used, they need to be passed
    explicitly to a shell implementation of some kind. Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'dmesg | tac'</pre><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">ExecStart=/bin/echo one ; /bin/echo "two two"</pre><p>This will execute <span class="command"><strong>/bin/echo</strong></span> two times,
    each time with one argument: "<code class="literal">one</code>" and
    "<code class="literal">two two</code>", respectively. Because two commands are
    specified, <code class="varname">Type=oneshot</code> must be used.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">ExecStart=/bin/echo / &gt;/dev/null &amp; \; \
/bin/ls</pre><p>This will execute <span class="command"><strong>/bin/echo</strong></span>

      configuration can sometimes fall into this category. Another use
      case is if a oneshot service shall not be executed each time
      when they are pulled in as a dependency, but only the first
      time.</p><p>For this, systemd knows the setting
      <code class="varname">RemainAfterExit=</code><code class="option">yes</code>, which
      causes systemd to consider the unit to be active if the start
      action exited successfully. This directive can be used with all

      Therefore, if only one process is left after the original
